# ------Part 1------

Create a correlation table between %2Y All, %4Y All, %4EngTot4yr, and %CSSTEMH4yr.  In text, report which correlations are statistically significant (if any) and comment on the strength of any relationships you observe. Run parametric and non-parametric versions. 


Read in Data and Create a DataFrame of  salient columns.
```{r}
all_degrees <- read.csv("PS_Degrees.csv", header = TRUE)

names(all_degrees)[1] <- "div_name"
percent_degrees <- all_degrees %>%
  select("Div_num", "div_name", "X.2r", "X.4yr", "X.EngTot4yr", "X.CSSTEMH4yr" ) %>%
  transform(X.2r = X.2r * 100) %>%
  transform(X.4yr = X.4yr * 100) %>%
  transform(X.EngTot4yr = X.EngTot4yr * 100) %>%
  transform(X.CSSTEMH4yr = X.CSSTEMH4yr * 100)
```

Run correlation 
```{r}
my_correlations <- percent_degrees %>% select() %>% cor()
print(my_correlations)
```

# ------Part 2------
Run a simple regression using principal salary in a county to predict teacher salary in that county. Interpret the results of the model and discuss how good the fit is. Discuss in practical terms how to interpret the regression coefficient. Evaluate if there are any outliers and adjust the model if needed.

Read in Data and Create a DataFrame of  salient columns.
```{r warning=FALSE}
prinData <- read.csv("Prin_Salary.csv", header = TRUE)
teachData <- read.csv("Teach_Salary.csv", header = TRUE)

```
Need to change columns containing salary to integers
```{r}
prinData <- prinData%>%
    mutate_at(vars(starts_with("FY20")), as.numeric)
```
  Clean both DFs so that we have only the columns we need.  
```{r}
prinData_sub <- prinData %>%
  select(div_name, starts_with("FY20")) 
  
teachData_sub <- teachData %>%
  select(div_name, starts_with("FY20"))
```
Next I will reshape the data from wide to long so that it is easier to plot.
```{r}
prinData_long <- gather(prinData_sub, Year, Salary,  FY2005P:FY2016P)
teachData_long <- gather(teachData_sub, Year, Salary,  FY2005T:FY2016T)
```
Some columns have salaries < 0, replace them with NA
```{r}
prinData_long [prinData_long  <= 0] <- NA
teachData_long [teachData_long  <= 0] <- NA
```
Join Principle & Teacher data with full join.
```{r}
p
salary_data <- full_join(prinData_Tmean,teachData_Tmean)
```

# ------Part 3------
Randomly divide the group of counties from (2) in two halves.  Run a simple regression on each half.  Compare the results from each of these two samples with what you know the population answers to be and discuss any differences you see in these two estimates of the true values and if the confidence intervals from these samples encompass the results of the original population regression from (2). Plot scatterplots of these different datasets with models and use ggplot to add the lines on too. 

***
# ------Part 4------
Run a multiple regression.  Choose an outcome variable of interest from the one of the degree percentage variables.  Choose one predictor variable from the tables provided to pretend it is the theory variable. Choose two additional predictor variables from the tables to be the “additional” possible predictor variables. Interpret the results of the models and discuss how good a fit are the models, including whether or not the second level model is better than the first. Discuss in practical terms how to interpret the regression coefficient. Evaluate if there are any outliers and adjust the model if needed.  Compute relevant diagnostics, produce and interpret plots, etc. to demonstrate your knowledge of various means of checking assumptions.
